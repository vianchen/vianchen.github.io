I struggled to keep my grades decent, limped through the intricate courses, was depressed to the extent in which I cried myself awake every single day. Luckily the journey was made so much easier by the wonderful people I’ve met. You taught me how to love myself and be strong, so to you guys: thank you.</p>\n<p>I haven’t always been the perfect version everybody expected me to be, and I probably never will. I potentially let many people down, but that was never my intention. Therefore to whomever felt they’d been mistreated: sorry.</p>\n<p>The past five years have witnessed truly the most gorgeous pages of my growth. I don’t know what’s to come for the next three years, but at least I won’t be afraid. Again, a great and sincere thank you to all you guys who’ve always supported me and loved me. <strong>I couldn’t imagine it without you. ❤️</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Graduation Thoughts","date":"June 21, 2021","description":"Whoever said it’s easy in college must’ve been really fortunate.
